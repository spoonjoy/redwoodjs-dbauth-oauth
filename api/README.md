# API Package for RedwoodJS dbAuth OAuth Plugin

This is the `api` package of the RedwoodJS DBAuth OAuth Plugin. It manages the server-side logic, handling the communication with the OAuth provider and the token management.

The `api` package closely follows the DBAuth integration pattern, initializing a class called `OAuthHandler` that contains all the OAuth business logic and config parameters. It also takes in the `DbAuthHandler` instance so that it can reuse some of its functionality and configurations.

## Motivation
The `api` package aims to simplify the server-side handling of the OAuth process.

## Setup Instructions
Detailed setup instructions will be provided here.
